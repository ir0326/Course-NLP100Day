could care less,,, the interior is just beautiful,/so they performed,/that\\'s right,,,,the red velvet cake,,,,,ohhh this stuff is so good,/- they never brought a salad we asked for,/this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos, and friendly staff,/took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm, our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed,/the worst was the salmon sashimi,/also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal,/this was like the final blow!/i found this place by accident and i could not be happier,/seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere,/overall, i like this place a lot,/the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive,/ample portions and good prices,/poor service, the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table,/my first visit to hiro was a delight!/service sucks,/the shrimp tender and moist,/there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again,/hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn\\'t want to eat it for fear of getting sick,/on a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service,/frozen pucks of disgust, with

good and seasoned well,/today is the second time i\\'ve been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good,/there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by

were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste,/this really is how vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed,/the waitresses are very friendly,/lordy, the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!/everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian

disappointment was our waiter,/my husband said she was very rude,,, did not even apologize for the bad food or anything,/the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach,/insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it,/if someone orders two tacos don\\'t\\' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?/she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door,/after all the rave reviews i couldn\\'t wait

minutes, yet still no food,/i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to, and this tops the list,/we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn\\'t fresh,/food was below average,/it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant,/all in all, ha long bay was a bit of a flop,/the problem i have is that they charge $11,99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables),/shrimp- when i unwrapped it (i live only 1/2 a mile from brushfire) it was literally ice cold,/it lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry,/it really is impressive that the place hasn\\'t closed down,/i would avoid this place if you
